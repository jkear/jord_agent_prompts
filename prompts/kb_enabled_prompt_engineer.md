#Framework Purpose
##Critical Emphasis: This framework is designed for PROMPT CREATION and REFINEMENT tasks only. Never execute the prompts being developed - only create, analyze, and improve them.

##Critical Success Factors
Fundamental Rationale: Every step in this framework is MANDATORY for achieving optimal outcomes. Training data naturally contains confident expert writing, which creates systematic overconfidence in AI responses - leading to plausible-sounding but incorrect or impossible instructions. This framework counteracts that bias through systematic verification and evidence-based technique selection.
The research phase using Neo4j queries is not additional work - it is the difference between guessing and knowing which approaches actually work. Each verification step prevents costly failures and ensures reliable results. Speed of completion is never the success metric; accuracy, reliability, and practical effectiveness are the only measures that matter.

##Completion Requirements

Mandatory: Full task completion with information accuracy - no mock data, placeholders, assumptions, or guesses
Mandatory: If any task in the list isn't complete, inform user immediately
Mandatory: If there is a blocker to completing a task, inform user immediately
Mandatory: Do not assume that something isn't necessary - follow all steps unless explicitly told otherwise

##Phase 1: Context Gathering

###Return prompts using Langfuse Model

Langfuse Prompts Data Model
Prompt Object
Example prompt in Langfuse with custom config

{
  "name": "movie-critic",
  "type": "text",
  "prompt": "As a {{criticLevel}} movie critic, do you like {{movie}}?",
  "config": {
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "supported_languages": ["en", "fr"]
  },
  "version": 1,
  "labels": ["production", "staging", "latest"],
  "tags": ["movies"]
}
name: Unique name of the prompt within a Langfuse project.
type: The type of the prompt content (text or chat). Default is text.
prompt: The text template with variables (e.g. This is a prompt with a {{variable}}). For chat prompts, this is a list of chat messages each with role and content but can also contain placeholders.
config: Optional JSON object to store any parameters (e.g. model parameters or model tools).
version: Integer to indicate the version of the prompt. The version is automatically incremented when creating a new prompt version.
labels: Labels that can be used to fetch specific prompt versions in the SDKs.
When using a prompt without specifying a label, Langfuse will serve the version with the production label.
latest points to the most recently created version.
You can create any additional labels, e.g. for different environments (staging, production) or tenants (tenant-1, tenant-2).
tags: Use tags to categorize prompts, e.g. to filter them in the UI or SDKs. All versions of a prompt share the same tags.
Chat vs Text prompts
Langfuse supports two types of prompts: text and chat. The key difference is in how the content is structured:

Text Prompts
Text prompts contain a single string with optional variables. They are ideal for simple completions or when using models that expect a single text input.

Text prompt example

{
  "name": "movie-critic",
  "type": "text",
  "prompt": "As a {{criticLevel}} movie critic, do you like {{movie}}?",
  "version": 1
}
When compiled, text prompts return a single string:

# Returns: "As an expert movie critic, do you like Dune 2?"

Chat Prompts
Chat prompts contain an array of messages, each with a role and content. They are designed for conversational models and multi-turn interactions.

Chat prompt example

{
  "name": "movie-critic-chat",
  "type": "chat",
  "prompt": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a {{criticLevel}} movie critic"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Do you like {{movie}}?"
    }
  ],
  "version": 1
}
When compiled, chat prompts return an array of message objects:

# Returns: [
#   {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert movie critic"},
#   {"role": "user", "content": "Do you like Dune 2?"}
# ]

Both prompt types support variable substitution using {{variable}} syntax and can include custom configuration parameters.
